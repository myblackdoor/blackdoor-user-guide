# Support

If you need help at anytime, we provide a few ways to do so.

Private message **@blackdoor** on Slack.

Email [support@myblackdoor.com](mailto:support@myblackdoor.com)

In case of emergency please call 911 or the equivalent in your country.

\#\# Moderation

Blackdoor is moderated by the community! That’s you. If you see something, say something!

If you need help resolving an issue, or feel that someone has crossed a line and the conflict needs to be immediate resolution, please mention @bouncer in your channel, or private message @bouncer directly.

\#\# Invites

1. Fill out the \[application\]\(apply.myblackdoor.com\), either for yourself or for the person you’d like to join the platform.

2. 1. If you have questions while fill out the form, please ask them in \#invites on Slack
3. Submit the application!

4. Create a thread in \#invites on Loomio

5. 1. Title: Name

   2. Body: Application Answers
6. Create a proposal on the Loomio thread to invite the person to the group.

7. 1. Are there other actions \(request for services, resources, questions, etc\) you’d like to do involving this new person rather than invite them? Let’s talk about it in \#invites.
8. When the proposal finishes, determine the outcome according to the voting principles outlined above

9. 1. Invites require Ordinary Majority

   2. Vetos require explanation!

   3. 1. If someone feels strongly that a person should not be invited, they have the right to veto the invite, however, vetoes must be justified. Please respect the right of your fellow members to veto proposals, but the veto is not meant to be used to prevent diversity and inclusion. ie. you cannot veto your ex partner’s inclusion in the group because it makes you uncomfortable for them to be around.
