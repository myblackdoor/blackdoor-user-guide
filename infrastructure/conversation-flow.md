## Conversation Flow and Escalation

Use Slack for:

1. Immediate conversations

2. 1. Slack goes away! Although there is searchable history, it only goes back to 10000 messages for the entire team unless we want to pay $7/user/month. Let’s talk about this as a community!
3. Gestating thoughts

4. Personal interactions

5. If something feels more “permanent” or needs input from people not currently present \(time zones are a thing!\) then please move your conversation to Loomio.

6. 1. If you’re not sure, ask the channel!

   2. 1. “Should this discussion be moved to loomio?”

Use Loomio for:

1. Important discussions that involve the entire community or a subset.

2. Creating proposals to suggest action items and resolutions for discussion

3. Evaluating the results and effects of previous proposals and resulting actions
