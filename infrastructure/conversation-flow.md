## Conversation Flow and Escalation

Use Slack for:

1. Immediate conversations, personal interactions, gestating thoughts...
   1. Slack goes away! Although there is searchable history, it only goes back to 10,000 messages for the entire team unless we want to pay $7/user/month. Let’s talk about this as a community.
2. If something feels more “permanent” or needs input from people not currently present \(time zones are a thing!\) then please move your conversation to Loomio.

   1. If you’re not sure, ask the channel! “Should this discussion be moved to Loomio?”

Use Loomio for:

1. Important discussions that involve the entire community or a subset.

2. Creating proposals to suggest action items and resolutions for discussion.

3. Evaluating the results and effects of previous proposals and resulting actions.

4. Voting on new members, action items, and proposals.
