# Slack

Slack is a chat platform designed to make chatting and sharing content with both small and large groups of people as easy as possible. Slack provides both general and private channels for group conversations, as well as the ability to have direct messages with any number of participants.

A note about direct messages:

Direct messages are awesome! It’s great to talk to people 1 on 1 or in small groups, but please be aware that you can accidentally exclude people from conversations that they might want \(or need\) to be involved. It’s our job as a community to stay aware and to move conversations to the appropriate format, for more about this, please see the section below about conversation flow and escalation.

Do Not disturb:

You can setup do not disturb hours by doing \(TODO\)

Notification preferences \(TODO\), muting, etc

@mentions
