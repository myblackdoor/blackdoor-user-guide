# Loomio

Loomio is a platform for community decision making.

1. Making proposals

2. Voting on proposals/action items

3. Threads are for more serious conversations that need input from multiple people.

## Voting

1. Ordinary Majority \(75% approval, rounded to the nearest person\)

2. Special Majority \(90% approval, rounded to the nearest person\)

3. Vetos

4. 1. Clear explanation required
5. Abstention

6. 1. A neutral vote on a proposal

   2. 1. We encourage involvement by all of our members in all discussions and votes that they feel are relevant. Make your voice heard! A neutral vote shows support for a proposal through your conscious participation, but also expresses your desire to abstain from effecting the outcome.
   3. No vote before a proposal closes

   4. 1. Not voting is not participating!
