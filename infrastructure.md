# Infrastructure

Blackdoor is a cross platform community that leverages different tools for different purposes.

1. Chat: Slack

2. Decision Making: Loomio

3. Documents, File Storage: Google Drive

4. Surveys: Typeform

5. Meetings: Calend.ly, Appear.in

The Blackdoor team is responsible for managing the integration of these technical tools, including the production and management of code.

If you have a question about the use of a tool, please do not hesitate to reach out for help in \#tech-help on Slack. No questions are dumb questions, these things are complicated, and those of us who have more experienced are encouraged to help those who are new.

Blackdoor is a communication system composed of corresponding Slack channels and Loomio subgroups. Topics can be proposed by any member and after voted approval the corresponding channels and subgroups will be setup by Blackdoor.
